Find all the NBA player movements this summer 2025 using this website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2025%E2%80%9326_NBA_season_transactions, clear and concisely list out the player name, from team, to team. if a player has multiple movements, only show from team of the start of the summer, to team as the final team. for example, player A moves to team 1, then team 2 then team 3. from team should be 1, to team should be 3. make a table for this and store to trades.md i have created. if the from team and to team are the same, don't include this player at all.
